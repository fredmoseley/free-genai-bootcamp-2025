## Student Input
Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?


## Examples
Here are examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score and why the example is scored the way it is.
<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
        - BAD: The Japanese column in the vocabulary table is empty, should contain the japanese characters.
        - BAD: The first sentence "Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a table of vocabulary to get us started:" is uneccessary, should show the vocabulary table first.
        - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
        - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        ## Vocabulary Table

        | Japanese | Romaji | English |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | | kuma | bear |
        | | tobira | door |
        | | mottanai | to leave something out |
        | | gomi | garbage |
        | | iru | to be, to exist |
        | | shiteiru | to do something and be in the state of having done it |


        ## Sentence Structure

        We have two clauses:
        * "Bears are at the door"
        * "Did you leave the garbage out?"

        A possible sentence structure could be:


        [Clause 1: Bears are at the door]
        [Clause 2: Did you leave the garbage out?]


        To connect these two clauses, we might use a question word or a conjunction.

        How would you connect these two clauses in Japanese?

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Japanese | Type |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
    | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
    | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
