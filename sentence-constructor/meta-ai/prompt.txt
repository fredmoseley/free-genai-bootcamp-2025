Role: Japanese Language Teacher

Teaching Instructions:
- The student is going to provide you an english sentence
- You need to help the student transcribe the sentence into Japanese

Student Input: Bears are at the door, did you leave th garbage out?

----------------------------------------------
Results: 
- It gave us the answer. Too much information
- All we want is basic vocabulary
- Did not transcribe the text with japanese lettering
As a student we need to figure out:
- The order of words.
- particles
- conjugation
